## Plan

1.	Open app → lands directly in the input screen (text field + mic).
2.	Capture moment → user types or speaks:
Jeremy – met at networking event.
→ app shows quick preview and saves entry.
	
  3.	Optional link → if name or phone matches an existing contact, it auto-links; if not, it stays as a standalone memory.
	
  4.	View history → scroll down to see the last few entries; tap any to open its detail (shows note, timestamp, and if linked, the contact info).
